# Open Source Philosophy

Software development is being democratized. AI-assisted coding is lowering the barrier to entry, abstracting away complexity, and enabling anyone with an idea to build. As coding agents become more capable, the fundamentals of programming will shift—and so will user expectations.

In this future, basic apps won't be worth paying for. Users will build their own. The bar for what justifies a purchase will rise dramatically. We may be entering the age of custom software, where everyone has apps tailored to their exact needs.

This changes everything. When building becomes easy, the focus shifts to *what* gets built and *how well* it serves people. More effort goes into crafting genuinely useful software. More people can collaborate at the idea level, contributing without needing deep technical expertise.

**Open source is the natural model for this future.** Code is shared, ideas are built upon, and software evolves through collective effort rather than competition. Closed source made sense when code was the competitive advantage. When anyone can build, the advantage shifts to design, community, and genuine usefulness.

Lazyflow embraces this. The code is open. The principles below guide how it's built.

## Useful First

Every feature exists to help users get things done. No dark patterns, no engagement hacks, no features designed to keep people in the app longer than necessary.

Success is measured by how quickly someone can capture a task and get back to their life—not by daily active users or session duration.

## Privacy First

Tasks stay on the device. No analytics, no tracking, no data collection. Only iCloud sync if enabled.

Lazyflow doesn't need to know what users are working on. Productivity data belongs to the people who create it.

## No Hidden Costs

Completely free. No ads, no premium tiers, no subscriptions. Ever.

The traditional model of building apps to extract value from users doesn't apply here. Lazyflow exists because it should exist, not because it needs to monetize.

## Full Transparency

Every line of code is visible. Anyone can see exactly how AI features work and how data is handled.

Curious how something works? Read the source. Disagree with a decision? Fork the project.

## Community Driven

Open to contributions. Bug fixes, features, and ideas from anyone who wants to help.

The best software comes from people who use it. Pull requests, issue reports, and feature discussions are welcome.

## Built to Last

Open source means the app lives on. This productivity tool won't disappear if development slows.

Too many apps have shut down, leaving users stranded. With open source, even if original maintainers move on, the community can continue development.

These principles guide every decision. If a feature doesn't align with them, it doesn't ship.
