# Documentation Updates

Auto-loaded after feature implementation to ensure docs stay current.

## File Locations

| What | Where | When to Update |
|------|-------|---------------|
| Roadmap | `docs/project/roadmap.md` | New feature added or milestone changes |
| User Flows | `docs/project/user-flows.md` | User journey or interaction changes |
| Design System | `docs/project/design-system.md` | New components, tokens, or patterns |
| Architecture | `docs/project/architecture.md` | New services, data models, or layers |
| Deployment | `docs/project/deployment.md` | CI/CD or deployment process changes |
| README | `README.md` | Major features that change app capabilities |
| Release Notes | `fastlane/metadata/en-US/release_notes.txt` | Auto-generated by `scripts/generate-release-notes.sh` — rarely edit manually |
| Promotional Text | `fastlane/metadata/en-US/promotional_text.txt` | Before App Store submission — NOT auto-generated |
| Description | `fastlane/metadata/en-US/description.txt` | App scope or feature set changes |
| Keywords | `fastlane/metadata/en-US/keywords.txt` | New searchable features |

## Screenshot Conventions

When UI changes:
1. Take screenshots on iPhone 17 Pro simulator in both light and dark modes
2. Save to `docs/site/assets/screenshots/{light,dark}/`
3. Naming: `{number}-{feature-name}.png` (e.g., `21-smart-learning.png`)
4. Add to `docs/site/design/index.html` (design gallery, not landing page)
5. Update design system version in the footer

App Store screenshots go to `docs/assets/screenshots/appstore/` (1284x2778 iPhone 6.5").

## Release-Specific Documentation

- `release_notes.txt` is auto-generated from CHANGELOG.md by CI — only edit manually for pre-release testing
- `promotional_text.txt` is NEVER auto-generated — update before each App Store submission
- CHANGELOG.md is managed by Release Please from conventional commit messages
